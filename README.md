#This is a chrome extension v3 which acts as a personal tasklist where you can add the tasks you want to complete. You can do the following:
1. Add the tasks you want to complete and press on 'Add Task' button to add the task to the list.
2. Once the task is completed, you can mark the task as complete and also delete it.
3. The extension also shows you the task which are pending and which are completed to better track the status.
4. The data entered also would persist, even if you refresh the page.


Now, go to Google Chrome and follow these steps to load the extension:

Open a new tab and navigate to chrome://extensions.
Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right corner.
Click on the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner.
Browse to the location where you saved the .zip file and select it.
